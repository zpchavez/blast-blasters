# Blast Blasters
#### It's a Blast!

Blast Blasters is a 4-player local free-for-all in which the player
that takes the lead must choose to augment their foes in order to level
the playing field!

### How to Play

Blast Blasters requires gamepads and Google Chrome. Only XBox360 controllers have been
tested, but other controllers supported by the Gamepad API _might_ work.

You can play the game [here](https://zpchavez.github.io/blast-blasters).
